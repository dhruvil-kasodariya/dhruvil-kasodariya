I created a website where users can explore international cricket teams and access player statistics. The homepage displays a list of teams, and users can click on a team to view its players. The player list allows searching by name and filtering by role.

To see player statistics, users can click on a player card, which shows basic information, batting stats, and bowling stats. It includes details like runs scored, average, strike rate, wickets taken, bowling average, and economy rate.

I added user login and registration features to access the website. Users must log in to explore the site fully. The front-end is built with React.js and Redux, hosted on Vercel. The back-end uses Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, hosted on Render.

Source code:

Front-end: https://github.com/iambunty45/cricket-player-info-frontend.git
Back-end: https://github.com/iambunty45/cricket-player-info-backend.git
Live demo: https://cricket-player-info-frontend-vbd3.vercel.app

The website provides a comprehensive list of international cricket teams, player statistics, and user login functionality. The front-end is built with React.js and Redux, ensuring an efficient user interface. Vercel hosts the front-end, providing seamless deployment.

The back-end utilizes Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB for data handling. The server is hosted on Render, ensuring reliability. MongoDB efficiently manages player information and statistics.

By registering and logging in, users can access personalized features. The website offers a user-friendly experience, enabling users to save preferences, create lists, and interact with others. User authentication enhances data security and access control.

The website offers a concise and interactive platform for cricket enthusiasts. Feel free to explore the live demo and access player statistics, teams, and other features. If you have any questions, please let me know. Enjoy the cricket experience!
